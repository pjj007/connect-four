# Connect Four
Connect Four game with GUI for two players. Written using Java. 

I initially uploaded this code in my Bitbucket repository. 

## Introduction
The features implemented in this java project are the basic rules without the Artificial Computer (AI). Therefore, only human players can interact. Once the main method is run, a connect four board is printed out to the console and underneath it prompts the user to either type in play, save, or load. To play, user must type in the word “play” and any integer ranging from 1 to 7. This number is to place the disk in one of the columns. This goes in a loop until either there is a winner or the game is draw.

## Built With

* Java in Eclipse
* JavaFX Scene Builder

## Future Improvements

* Would like to build the AI logic
* Save the game in a json file so user can continue the game later, and upload the file to Google Firebase or similar sort
